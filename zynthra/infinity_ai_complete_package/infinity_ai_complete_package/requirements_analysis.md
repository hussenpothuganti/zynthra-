# Infinity AI App Requirements Analysis

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the requirements for the Infinity AI mobile application. The application consists of a React Native frontend and a Node.js backend with MongoDB database. The analysis covers all features, design elements, language support, and integration points specified in the user's requirements.

## Frontend Requirements (React Native)

### Core Features

The Infinity AI mobile application requires implementation of a Jarvis-like AI chat assistant with voice interaction capabilities. This assistant must support both English and Telugu languages, providing a natural and intuitive user experience. The voice interaction system should be capable of understanding and responding to user queries in both languages, requiring integration with speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies.

An Emergency SOS button is required as a critical safety feature. This functionality must be capable of sharing the user's live GPS coordinates with pre-saved contacts in emergency situations. The implementation needs to include GPS tracking, contact management, and secure transmission of location data.

The application must incorporate a gamified learning system through daily skill-based challenges. These challenges should award experience points (XP) to users upon completion and maintain a leaderboard to foster healthy competition among users. This requires implementation of challenge generation logic, XP tracking, and leaderboard management.

An automated ticket and product ordering assistant is required to simplify purchasing processes. This feature should provide a guided UI to help users navigate through ordering processes, potentially integrating with external services for actual transactions.

A Career Mentor feature must be implemented to provide AI-powered resume tips, job links, and career timeline visualization. This requires natural language processing capabilities to analyze resumes, integration with job listing services, and timeline visualization components.

Private peer-to-peer (P2P) chat and call functionality using WebRTC technology is required. This feature must ensure secure and private communication between users, including both text messaging and voice/video calls.

### UI/UX Requirements

The user interface must be modern and animated, incorporating ripple effects for interactive elements and story sliders for content presentation. The design should be visually appealing and provide smooth transitions between different screens and states.

The application must support both light and dark themes to accommodate user preferences and different lighting conditions. This requires implementation of a theming system and appropriate color schemes for both modes.

The primary color scheme should utilize Deep Purple and Electric Blue as the main colors, creating a distinctive and modern visual identity for the application.

### Language Support

Full support for English, Telugu, and Hindi languages is required, with real-time translation capabilities. This necessitates implementation of a robust localization system and integration with translation services to provide seamless language switching and content translation.

## Backend Requirements (Node.js + MongoDB)

### Authentication and Security

User authentication must be implemented using email and password credentials, with JSON Web Token (JWT) based session management. This requires secure password handling, token generation, validation, and refresh mechanisms.

All API routes must be secured appropriately to prevent unauthorized access, and critical events should be logged for monitoring and debugging purposes.

### AI Integration

An AI assistant route must be implemented, utilizing either GPT-3.5 or a free alternative like Mistral. This requires integration with the chosen AI model's API and handling of conversation context.

A daily AI challenge generator is required, which should create challenges based on user skill tags stored in the database. This requires implementation of challenge creation logic and skill-based difficulty adjustment.

Resume suggestion functionality must be implemented as part of the Career Mentor feature, requiring natural language processing capabilities to analyze resumes and provide improvement suggestions.

### Data Management

MongoDB should be used for data storage, with appropriate schemas for user profiles, chat history, reminder logs, career milestones, and other application data.

Real-time GPS tracking endpoints are required for the Emergency SOS feature, necessitating efficient storage and retrieval of location data.

Chat history and reminder logs must be stored with timestamps for accurate record-keeping and retrieval.

### Integration Features

Browser automation endpoints using Puppeteer are required for ticket and product ordering tasks, allowing the backend to interact with external websites on behalf of users.

A WebSocket server using Socket.IO must be implemented for P2P voice and video signaling, facilitating real-time communication between users.

A multilingual support API using LibreTranslate or a similar service is required to enable real-time translation across the application.

## Technical Requirements

### Scalability and Performance

The backend architecture must be designed for scalability to accommodate growing user numbers and increasing data volumes.

Performance optimization is essential for both frontend and backend components to ensure a smooth user experience, particularly for real-time features like voice interaction and P2P communication.

### Open Source Integration

Open-source libraries should be utilized wherever possible to accelerate development and benefit from community-maintained code. This applies to both frontend and backend components.

## Conclusion

The Infinity AI application requires a comprehensive set of features spanning AI assistance, emergency services, skill development, career guidance, and communication. The implementation must balance functionality with performance, security, and user experience considerations. The multilingual support and modern UI design are key differentiators that should receive particular attention during development.
